### What Is BHAGs (Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals)

BHAGs stands for Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals. A BHAG is a compelling, long-term goal that can inspire and motivate groups of people to take action, with urgency.

### Why Do BHAGs (Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals)

A BHAG is clear and compelling, needs little explanation; people get it right away. They can be used to inspire organisations and provide a huge target for an organisation to hit.

### How to do BHAGs (Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals)

There are four categories that can guide the creation of BHAGs:

* Role model BHAGs involve selecting a role model (usually another business/ organisation) and seeking to emulate their traits and success e.g. Facebook
* Common enemy BHAGs involve David vs Goliath motivation - with the focus being to ‘defeat a common enemy’. Collins and Porras cite the examples of Nike’s 1960s mission to “Crush Adidas”
* : As the word implies, a target BHAG involves setting a huge, clear, definable target e.g. Walmart.
* Remain competitive by revitalising. Focused internally rather than externally, internal transformation BHAGs seek to transform your company from within.e.g. Apple in 90s

**Example: The Moon landing**

On 25 May 1961 JFK stated "that this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth”. No need for a verbose speech or document, the world understood: the U.S. would put a man on the moon—and bring him back safely.
